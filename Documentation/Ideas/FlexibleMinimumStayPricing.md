# Flexible Minimum Stay with Increased Pricing

## Concept
Allow bookings shorter than the minimum stay requirement, provided guests pay the equivalent of the minimum stay price.

## Feature Overview
- Property-level option to "allow shorter stays with increased pricing"
- Guests can book for fewer nights than the minimum stay
- Charge based on the full minimum stay period, regardless of actual stay length

## Potential Benefits
1. Increased booking flexibility for guests
2. Higher occupancy rates
3. Maintained revenue for shorter stays
4. Attractive for business travelers or short-term needs

## Implementation Considerations
1. Property-level setting to enable/disable this feature
2. Clear pricing communication to guests
3. Possible absolute minimum stay threshold
4. Seasonal applicability
5. Integration with existing booking rules
6. Pricing display strategy

## Questions for Future Development
1. Applicability to all minimum stay rules or just general ones?
2. Impact on total price calculation
3. Restrictions on minimum stay length with this feature
4. Interaction with existing gap stay allowances
5. Potential for discounts on these shorter stays

## Next Steps
1. Define clear answers to the questions above
2. Determine exact desired behavior
3. Plan for clear user communication in the booking interface
4. Consider implications for pricing calculations and display
5. Evaluate potential impact on overall booking patterns and revenue

## Notes
This feature idea is currently on hold due to complexity. When revisiting, consider starting with a simplified version and iterating based on user feedback and operational impact.
